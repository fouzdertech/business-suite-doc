## Advanced Template Customization

For more extensive customizations, you can override the default PDF invoice template:

1.  Navigate to the `system/overrides/` directory
2.  Locate the file `invoice_pdf.sample.php`
3.  Create a copy and rename it to `invoice_pdf.php`
4.  Customize the `invoice_pdf.php` file according to your needs

> Customizing this way will save your customization even you update the application.

This method allows you to:

-   Modify the invoice layout structure
-   Add custom fields or sections
-   Change fonts and styling
-   Adjust positioning of elements
-   Add custom headers or footers
